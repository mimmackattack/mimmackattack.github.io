This project details how to plot a sphere, a cube, an octahedron, and every continuous shape in between using a single function, with digressions on principles of numerical analysis, coordinate systems, and the inner workings of plotting libraries. Culminates with a live, interactive 3D plot.\nView this project in two versions: Python | JavaScript"

    "text": "Hello! I’m a data analyst working with the Harvard Aging Brain Study and affiliated satellite studies on Alzheimer’s Disease research.\nI love R and data visualization (I’m a huge fan of the R “tidyverse,” and this website was built with Quarto)! However, I’ve also got an especially soft spot for numerically complex projects where I can pull from my academic background in applied math. My weirdest simple pleasure is data cleaning—I love wrangling nasty datasets!\nI currently live in Somerville, Massachusetts, but I grew up in North Carolina and spent several years in California for graduate school. In my free time I love biking along the Minuteman Bikeway, racking up Dunkin’ rewards, and reading science fiction & fantasy novels.\nThis website contains my CV and a portfolio of some of my favorite personal projects I’ve created using R, Python, and Javascript."
