## [Plotting the 3D *p*-Norm Unit Ball](https://mimmackk.github.io/unitball/){style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;"}

A walkthrough of the problem-solving process for a tricky 3D plotting question using the Plotly library. This project details how to plot a sphere, a cube, an octahedron, and every continuous shape in between using a single function, with digressions on principles of numerical analysis, coordinate systems, and the inner workings of plotting libraries. Culminates with a live, interactive 3D plot.

View this project in two versions: [Python](https://mimmackk.github.io/unitball/) \| [JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/@mimmackk/unitball)

## [Geographic Spread of University Departments](https://tuftsobserver.org/multimedia/major-sprawl/){style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;"}

An interactive map of the geographic spread of courses by department at Tufts University. This project was built with JavaScript to accompany an article for the *Tufts Observer* campus magazine.

Group effort: Kayden Mimmack co-designed, co-developed, performed data collection, integrated data with Google Maps API, and edited responsive mobile design.
