	<h1>Bio | Katherine Mimmack</h1>

	<p> I was born with glass bones and paper 
		skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every 
		afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in 
		agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep. As you 
		can imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but 
		luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling 
		chocolate bars.</p>
