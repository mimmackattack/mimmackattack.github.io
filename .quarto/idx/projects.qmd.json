[View on GitHub](https://github.com/mimmackk/tidytuesday).\n\n[![](images/tidytuesday.png){fig-alt=\"Collage of four data visualizations for Tidy Tuesday\"}](https://github.com/mimmackk/tidytuesday)\n\n## [Plotting the 3D *p*-Norm Unit Ball](https://mimmackk.github.io/unitball/){style=\"color: inherit; text-decoration: none;\"}\n\nA walkthrough of the problem-solving process for a tricky 3D plotting question using the Plotly library. This project details how to plot a sphere, a cube, an octahedron, and every continuous shape in between using a single function, with digressions on principles of numerical analysis, coordinate systems, and the inner workings of plotting libraries. Culminates with a live, interactive 3D plot.\n\nView this project in two versions: [Python](https://mimmackk.github.io/unitball/) \\| [JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/@mimmackk/unitball)\n\n[![](images/pnorm.jpg){fig-alt=\"Image of several stages of construction of a 3D mesh grid, an octahedron, and a sphere\"}](https://mimmackk.github.io/unitball/)\n\n## [Hopfield Network Simulation](https://mimmackk.github.io/hopfield/){style=\"color: inherit; text-decoration: none;\"}\n\nA live, interactive simulation of a Hopfield network---a type of neural network that models associative memory.
