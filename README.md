Currently all of the individual html pages load and interact properly with
the css stylesheet. Everything is uploaded to the CS account and loads properly on the web browser, but the photo on the index page loads very slowly.

I spent approximately 5 hours on the project.

I did not work with others, but I used the following pages as helpful resources:
