Currently all of the individual html pages load and interact properly with
the css stylesheet. Still have not officially uploaded to cs account yet, though.

One thing I wanted to do was split the index page down the center and have the
image on one side and the text on the other, but I haven't figured out how to
do this yet. I tried using float:right and margin-right:50% for my img rule,
but that didn't work and the text just fell below it. Still looking into how to
make that work.

So far I've spent approximately 4 hours on the project.
